# JavaCoreCapgemini – Core Java Learning Log

This is my learning log for Core Java.

I’m going through the basics step by step — writing code to understand concepts like:
- Classes & Objects  
- Methods
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Exception Handling
- Collections
- And how Java works under the hood

Every file here is something I wrote to **test, break, fix, understand, and finally get right**.

This repo is not a polished project and not a tutorial.
It’s just me figuring things out, one small program at a time.

If you’re on a similar path, maybe you’ll find something useful here.
If you’ve already been through this — feel free to guide me or suggest improvements. I’m always open to learning.

Thanks for stopping by 👋
